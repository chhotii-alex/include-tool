Here's the start of the recursive file!
##define IMPOSSIBLE false
##define REASONABLE 42

##if ##FOO##
Since Foo is defined, we are doing it!

##if ##IMPOSSIBLE##
The impossible has occurred. IMPOSSIBLE has value ##IMPOSSIBLE##.
##elseif ##REASONABLE##
I'm a very reasonable file.
And the answer to everything is ##REASONABLE##.
##else
I don't know what to do...

##end

##end

In conclusion, might I say, this has been a great file.
