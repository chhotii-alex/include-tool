##define STATUS output
Here is my ##STATUS## file.
##include input2.txt
##env BAR
##if ##FOO##
FOO defined, and its value is ##FOO##.
##elseif ##BAR##
I have an environment variable named BAR defined,
and its value is ##BAR##. But I don't have a FOO.
##else
Both FOO and BAR are either undefined or false.
##end
##if ##EXTRASTUFF##
Here's some extra stuff if you asked for it.
##end
And, there's more stuff at the end of the file.
