This demonstrates getting ## into the final output.
To get ## into the final output, the input must contain ##HASHHASH##.
The ##HASHHASH## macro can co-exist with other macros on a line. 
Then we can have a final output file that discusses include's syntax, displaying examples
such as:
##if FOO
  -- line dependend on FOO --
##end
Enjoy!
